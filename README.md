Wayfinding
==========

jQuery plugin for interactive SVG maps. Wayfinding provides the shortest route through a series of one or more svg maps. It supports client side map processing or pretraversal of the maps with the server holding the cached traversals. It is useful for kiosks and interactive digital signage, but can also be used to share mobile maps.
